            "Sampladelia" is an umbrella term covering a vast range of contemporary halucinogenres -techno, hip-hop, house, jungle, electronica, swingbeat, post-rock, and more. "Sampladelic" refers to disorienting, perception- warping music created using the sampler
            and other forms of digital technology.

            <br> The sampler is a computer that converts sound into numbers, the zeros and ones of digital code. In its early days, the sampler was used primarily as a quote machine, a device for copying a segment of prerecorded music and replaying it
            on a keyboard at any pitch or tempo. But because the sound has been converted into digital data, the information can be easily rearranged. This means the source can be disguised to the point of unrecognizability, and it opens up a near-infinite
            realm of sound-morphing possibilities.

            <br> At its most advanced, sampladelia drastically expands on the recording methods developed by late-sixties psychedelia. Acid rock groups departed from the "naturalistic" model of recording (documenting the band in performance) and used
            multitracking, overdubbing, reversing, echo, and other sonic processes to create sounds that could never be achieved by a band playing in real time. This antinaturalistic aspect of sampling has been intensified by recent music technology developments
            like "hard disk editing," which is like having a recording studio with a mixing board and an array of effects inside your computer. With hard disk editing (aka digital multitrack recording), sound sources can be chopped up, stretched, treated,
            looped, and recombined, all within the "virtual" space of the computer.

            <br> The sampler is not necessarily the most important instrument in the tech no producer's arsenal. While some producers enthuse about the sampler as the ultimate creative tool ("the new electric guitar"), others prefer synthesizers (particularly
            old-fashioned analog synths, with their knobs and sliders) for their hands-on, real-time element, which requires traditional dexterous musicianship. Sampling breaks with traditional ideas of "musicality," though, and so I'm using "sampladelia"
            as a general rubric for electronic dance music's revolutionary implications: its radical break with the ideals of real-time interactive playing and natural acoustic space that still govern most music making.

            <br> Although the first people to use the technique via the expensive Fairlight Computer Musical Instrument were art rockers like Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush, the age of sampladelia really began when cheaper machines like the Emulator and
            Ensoniq Mirage fell into the hands of rap producers.

            <br> Although it can be performed live, techno is seldom born in real time. Rather, electronic music is programmed and assembled sequence by sequence, layer by layer. Even the separate constituents of a track, like keyboard riffs and arpeggios,
            don't necessarily come into being as discrete musical events. Step- writing, a technique whereby a rhythmic or melodic pattern is programmed into the sequencer note by note or written on the computer screen, allows for the construction of
            complicated riffs that are often beyond the real-time capabilities of even the most dexterous keyboardist. Not only does this make it easy to correct errors and add nuances, but sequences can be rearranged, edited, run backward, and generally
            messed around with on a trial-and-error basis. Furthermore, the same basic riff-pattern can be played in any "color," with the musician free to choose from a vast sonic palette of synthesized "instruments" and self-invented sampladelic timbres.

            <br> On the surface, all this would appear to constitute a radical break with the spontaneity of rock 'n' roll. In truth, from very early on in the music's history, these two poles of postmodern referentiality and musique concrete re-creation.
            The texture of these tracks still has a human, real-time feel, but the lifts are sufficiently brief or arcane as to preclude triggering specific pop- cultural associations in the listener. The model of creativity here is seventies jazz fusion;
            not only is the ideology borrowed from that period, but so are most of the samples. A lot of trip-hop and jungle is basically fusion on the cheap: instead of a band jamming together, the producer is like a bandleader deftly arranging the expert
            playing of musicians from different genres and eras. Trip-hopper Howie B, for instance, described his track "Martian Economics" as a "collaboration ... like me doing a tune with [keyboard legend] Jimmy Smith, even though he wasn't there."
            For Howie B and similar artists like Beck and DJ Shadow, part of the creative process is the preproduction research of going on record-buying sprees, then sifting through hundreds of hours of music for suitable samples. "I'll take anything,
            it can be as small as a triangle hit, and I'll spread it across a [sampling] keyboard and turn it into a tuned piano," says Howie. "I'll take a Latin timbale recorded in 1932 and make it into a percussion pattern, or snatch some vocal and
            take it four octaves down until it's a lion's roar."

            <br>Sampling was the logical extension of the hip-hop DJ's cut-'n'-mix vinyl bricolage. Shifting from the block party model of the DJ-and-MC, hip-hop became a studio-based art centered on the producer-as-auteur and rapper- as-poet. Meanwhile,
            in the UK, the new cut-rate samplers catalyzed the "DJ record" fad of 1987-88. Influenced by the Art of Noise, Mantronix, and ' Steinski, such artists as Coldcut, Bomb the Bass, M/A/R/R/S, and S'Express created breakbeat-driven sample collages
            that had hip-hop's funky feel but were uptempo enough to slot into a set of house music.

            <br>Critiques of sampling focused on the regurgitative, referential nature of the practice, the gleeful disregard for conventional musical skill, and the fact that these records were brazen extravaganzas of sonic larceny. Enthusiasts promptly
            seized these accusations and turned them around into proof of sampling's subversiveness: its transgression of copyright, its punk-style democratization of music making. Coldcut's "Beats + Pieces" preempted and mocked the anti-sampling fogies
            with the sleeve slogan "Sorry, but this just isn't music." By 1990, sampladelia had blossomed into a more subtle and covert aesthetic. Hip-hop and house producers increasingly eschewed blatant lifts in favor of microscopic fragments from obscure
            sources partly out of a desire to be more creative and partly because music publishers had their hawk-eyes trained on the extra royalties they could glean by prosecuting unauthorized use of their clients' compositions. Once the sampling-as-theft
            notion dropped off the agenda, attitudes to the instrument split between postmodernist and modernist. For some, the sampler is still a tool for collage, for elaborate games of Pop Art referentiality. For others, the sampler represents an easy-as-pie
            update of musique concrete's tricky and time-consuming tape-splicing techniques. Here, digital technology functions as a crucible for sonic alchemy the transmutation of source material into something "new," sounds that seemingly originate
            from imaginary or even unimaginable instruments. The guiding ethos is a fierce conviction that all samples must be masked, all sources un- recognizable. Yet there's a sense in which this approach reduces the sampler to a synthesizer and thereby
            misses what is truly idiomatic to the machine: taking the known and making it strange, yet still retaining an uncanny, just- recognizable trace of the original's aura.

            <br>In late-nineties dance music, sampladelia mostly falls somewhere between 1 ·~''I 7 .} JI ·1 1I 'n lI ·t GENERATION ECSTASY I 045 In The Third Wave, Alvin Toffler wrote of a "blip culture" where "we are all be- sieged and blitzed by fragments
            of imagery, contradictory or unrelated, that shake up our old ideas and come shooting at us in the form of broken or disembodied 'blips.' " Sampladelia can be seen as a new kind of realism that reflects the fact that the late-twentieth-century
            mediascape has become our new Nature; it can be diagnosed as a symptom of, but also an attempt to master and reintegrate the promiscuous chaos and babbling heteroglossia of the information society. But sampladelia may also be prophetic, offering
            hints of future forms of human identity and social organization. Cyber-theorist Arthur Kraker confronts i '111 ¢ :i1 I ·{} 'ii) Sampladelia is zombie music: dead sound reanimated like the zombi- a Haitian corpse brought back to robotlike half-life
            by a voodoo sorcerer, then used as a slave. Disembodied beats, licks, cries, and riffs born of human breath and sweat are vivisected from their original musical context and then literally galvanized, in its original meaning. (When electricity
            was first discovered, physicians would electrocute cadavers to make their limbs and facial muscles twitch, for the public's ghoulish delectation.) Early hip-hop sampling was like Frankenstein's monster, funk-limbs crudely bolted together,
            the stitching clearly audible. With its quasi-organic seamlessness, today's sampladelia is more like the chimera, that mythical monster composed of the parts of different animals. Its chimerical quality parallels digital video effects like
            morphing, where faces blend into each other imperceptibly and human bodies distend and mutate like Hanna-Barbera animations. In their jeremiad Data Trash: The Theory of the Virtual Class, Arthur Kraker and Michael Weinstein warn that the "archivalism"
            of cyber-culture is hatching "monstrous hybrids," that "archived body parts are disguised in the binary functionality of data and pooled into larger circulatory flows.''This could be a description of the process of converting the vinyl-encoded
            musical energy of flesh-and-blood musicians into the zeros and ones of binary code, which is then disseminated as currency throughout contemporary pop culture. This is the fin de millennium sampladelic supernova, where the last eighty years
            of pan-global recorded sound is decontextualized, deracinated, and utterly etherealized. naaleTMOM DEVI(I D¢ rock bands used studio technology to correct mistakes and overdub extra instrumental parts, if only to make the records sound as densely
            vibrant as the live band, In Rhythm and Noise: An Aesthetics of Rock, Theodore Gracyk argues that it is precisely rock's interest in phonography (the art of recording} that separates it from folk and jazz, where records are usually documents
            of a performance. In folk and jazz, it is respectively the song and the improvisation that count; in rock, the record is the basic unit of musical meaning. In this re- spect, hip-hop and techno represent the apotheosis of rock's interest in
            sound in itself (timbre, effects} and virtual space (unrealistic acoustics}.

            <br>Gracyk points out that even at the primal origin of rock 'n' roll - the Sun Sessions - studio artifice was involved, in the famous echo that Sam Philips slapped on Presley's voice, The brilliance of late-sixties psychedelia derives from
            the way artists like the Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, and Pink Floyd combined a gritty "feel" (live, interactive playing among seasoned band members} and the fantastical (hallucinatory effects, ultravivid timbres, an artificial sense of space conjured
            using echo and reverb}. Digital music abandons all the elements of "feel": the inflections and supple rhythmic interplay that communicate the fact that flesh-and-blood humans physically shaped this sound together in a real acoustic space.
            But by way of recompense, it dramatically intensifies the trompe /'oreille side of psychedelia: its fictitious psycho-acoustic space, its timbres and textures and sound shapes to which no ready real-world referents attach themselves. At its
            most inventive, sampladelia lures the listener into a sound world honeycombed with chambers that each have their own acoustics. This music is "like walking through a maze whose walls rearrange themselves with every step you take" (James Gleick's
            description of chaos theory's non- linear equations). If rock phonography uses multiple takes and overdubs to create a quasi- event, something that never "happened," what you hear on record usually sounds plausible as a real-time occurrence.
            Sampladelia goes further: it layers and concatenates musical fragments from different eras, genres, and places to create a time-warping pseudo-event, something that could never possibly have happened. Different acoustic spaces and recording
            "auras" are forced into uncanny adjacency. You could call it "deconstruction of the metaphysics of presence." You could also call it "magic." It's a kind of time travel, or seance, a conference call colloquy between ghosts in the sampling
            machine.
